4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.

    - I hope to gain a better overall understanding of systems programming and the underlying processes that run on the devices we use everyday.

5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).

    - I personally feel a bit unsure on my skills in C, and also with the fact that I have not taken CS281 (even though it is not a pre-req for this class). However, I will do my best to succeed in this class!
